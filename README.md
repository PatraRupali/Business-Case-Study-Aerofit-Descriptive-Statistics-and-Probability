Product Portfolio

KP281: Entry-level treadmill priced at $1,500.
KP481: Mid-level treadmill for runners, priced at $1,750.
KP781: Advanced treadmill with premium features, priced at $2,500.
Case Study Process

Data Import and Analysis

Import the dataset.
Analyze dataset structure and characteristics.
Outlier Detection

Use boxplots and descriptive statistics (e.g., difference between mean and median).
Feature Impact Analysis

Assess the impact of customer attributes like marital status and age on product preferences using count plots, histograms, and box plots.
Marginal Probabilities

Represent marginal probabilities, such as the percentage of customers purchasing KP281, KP481, or KP781, using tools like pandas.crosstab.
Correlation Analysis

Use heatmaps and pair plots to identify correlations among different factors.
Customer Profiling

Categorize customers by numerical attributes such as:
Age: young/old
Income: wealthy/middle income
Fitness: fit/not fit
Usage: regular/casual
Education: high/low
Leverage the crosstab function in pandas for customer segmentation.
Probability Analysis

Calculate marginal and conditional probabilities to find insights like the likelihood of a male customer buying a KP781 treadmill.
Recommendations and Insights

Provide actionable recommendations based on data-driven insights.
